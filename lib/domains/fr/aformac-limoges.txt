Thanks for looking at our application for your program.

About your message : 
    1) the university official website URL, if different from the domain you are submitting
	 
	https://www.aformac.fr

    2) an URL of a page on the official website where an IT-related long-term (>1 year) course is offered by the university

	You will find here the description of our course on the official website of our group : 
	https://www.aformac.fr/trouver-votre-solution-formation/titre-professionnel-developpeur-web-web-mobile
	
    3) an URL of a page or another proof (.pdf or a screenshot are OK) showing that the university recognizes the domain which you are submitting as an official email domain for the students.
	
	Our students aren't provided any email address by our group. They usually create a gmail address dedicated to the course. Only coaches are provided an email on aformac.fr domain.

	Hope it's not a too big problem. It would be a great addition to our course if we can give access to your product to our students as it is very popular on the employment market here.
