Kasetsart University registered a new domain "ku.th" in 2015,
which will be the only domain for future student email addresses.
The old domain ku.ac.th continues to be used by existing
Kasetsart student & faculty, but new students will have 
addresses of the form "username@ku.th".
Would you please add ku.th so newer students can take 
advantage of JetBrain's generous academic license for IntelliJ?

Thanks.
